        <p>Your peace of mind and well-being are important to us which is why we feel that finding the right counsellor
            who fits your needs and lifestyle is the first step to getting the type of help you want.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="para">
        <p>Based in Southampton, we help individuals from the age of 11 years old who are suffering from psychological
            distress. We believe that you are the expert in your own life, as such we aim to help in a respectful,
            non-judgemental way, age regardless.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="para">
        <p>We also work with organisations who provide respite care for families in need. Person-Centred counselling
            encourages autonomy and self-care in individuals, enabling them to think about their problems in a different
            way. If you are a company who provides care and are interested in providing confidential counselling, then
            please contact us to arrange a convenient appointment. At this time we will discuss health and safety
            arrangements and how the service will work in your company.

        </p>

    </div>
    <div class="Ques">
        <p>A - Our counsellor works with clients from the age of 11. This is because ethically we feel we do not have
            the necessary training to work with anyone under this age. Over this age we work with any group of client
            and do not discriminate on grounds of gender, sexual orientation or gender reassignment, religion or belief,
            race or disability.

        </p>
    </div>

            in date.

    <div class="Ques">
        <p>Q - You mention that we will establish a contract when we first meet. What does this mean?

        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Ques">
        <p>A - The contract sets out ethical and legal considerations for counselling. It provides guidelines so that we
            are both safe within our work. We will also cover what to do should you wish to complain about Talkfit
            Counselling Services or its employees.

        <p>A - We are required by the BACP to have regular supervision and will need to discuss our work with a
            qualified supervisor. We will not disclose your name or anything that would enable you to be identified.
            There are other circumstances where we are required to disclose information. This may involve a personal
            disclosure or a disclosure about a third party. We will always talk to you about how this will be dealt with
            before action.

        <p>Ethics and the law surrounding confidentiality are complex. I am happy to talk through any doubts you may
            have about when your confidentiality could be breached. I find that once the limits to confidentiality have
            been fully explored the client feels free to talk about whatever brought them to counselling in the first
            place.

        <p>Your peace of mind and well-being are important to us which is why we feel that finding the right counsellor
            who fits your needs and lifestyle is the first step to getting the type of help you want.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="p2">
        <p>Our first point of contact will be over the phone. Together, we will confirm where we will meet, privacy issues and anything else that you feel is important to aid our initial meeting.
            </p>
    </div>
    <div class="p2">
        <p>In the first session we will discuss how we will work together. We will talk about your expectations from counselling and how the Person-Centred approach will work with anything you bring up in the sessions.
            </p>
    </div>
    <div class="p2">
        <p>Our counsellor will explain how we work within the British Association for Counselling & Psychotherapy Ethical Guidelines such as boundaries and contracting and the limits of confidentiality.
            </p>
    </div>
    <div class="p2">
        <p>If you decide you would like to work with us, we will confirm together what time each week we will meet and frequency of the sessions. This can be for a set period or ongoing. We will review the process on a regular basis to make sure that you are benefiting from your counselling experience and that you are receiving value for money.

    <div class="p2">
        <p>Very occasionally we may collaberatively decide that a referral onto another service may be of benefit to you. You will always be consulted and your permission gained before a referral is made.

    <div class="p2">
        <p>Counselling is a unique experience and will mean different things to different people. We will work with you to ensure your best interests are cared for, and that your unique experience is right for you.

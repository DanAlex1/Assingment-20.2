        <p>Based in Southampton, we help individuals from the age of 11 years old who are suffering from psychological

        <p>We also work with organisations who provide respite care for families in need. Person-Centred counselling
            encourages autonomy and self-care in individuals, enabling them to think about their problems in a different
            way. If you are a company who provides care and are interested in providing confidential counselling, then
            please contact us to arrange a convenient appointment. At this time we will discuss health and safety
            arrangements and how the service will work in your company.</p>

        <p style="font-size:18px; color:#000000; font-weight:500; font-style:normal;">
            There are times when our normal coping strategies leave us feeling confused or angry. Therapy can assist by
            helping us see a problem from a different perspective.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size:18px; columns: #000000;; font-weight:500; font-style:normal;">
            Therapy can help motivate you to make changes towards new routines with a short course of Motivational
            Enhancement Therapy. If you have already made changes and are abstaining from substance misuse then therapy
            can help you become aware of past history that may have led to the unwanted behaviour.

        <p style="font-size:18px; columns: #000000;; font-weight:500; font-style:normal;">
            Anxiety can be crippling on a day to day basis. Therapy can help to reduce the level of threat and fear
            thereby enabling you to cope a little better.

            You have mounds to cope with both mentally and physically. At a time when your brain is developing at speed
            and societal expectations are high, a non-judgemental, confidential space to talk can help.
            The loss of someone close can be traumatic and confusing. Therapy can support you non-judgementally and
            sensitively through a dark time.

        <p style="font-size:18px; columns: #000000;; font-weight:500; font-style:normal;">
            Stress can be unquantifiable and symptoms may have no apparent origin. Therapy may help identify the cause
            possibly enabling you to think and react in a different way alleviating some or all of the symptoms.
